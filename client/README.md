# Aalto Grades client

## Running for development

Install the necessary Node modules:
```
$ npm ci
```
Start the client:
```
$ npm start
```

When the client is starting, a browser window should automatically open to the
URL of the client, if not, you can manually open http://localhost:3005 to
access it.

In order to run the client in any meaningful capacity, you must also start the
server. Please see `server/README.md` for instructions on running the server.

## Building for production

Install the necessary Node modules:
```
$ npm ci
```
Build the client:
```
$ npm run build
```

The built client will be available in the `build` directory generated by the
build script.

```
$ npm ci
```
Start the test runner:

$ npm test
```
